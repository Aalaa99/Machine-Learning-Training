## Benefits:
1. Certificate that can be used for field training 1 or field training 2.
2. Strong profile on Github.
3. Department award for top 3 students.
4. Students will be certified with a total of 140 hrs hands-on experience. 
5. Daily office hours for support/guidance.
6. Get the chance to meet new students who share your interests.
7. Start exploring and building models on Kaggle which is the largest online community for data scientists and machine learning practitioners.

## Evaluation Method to receive certificates:
1. Students must attend +80% of total sessions.
2. Students must hand in all the required projects within 48 hrs after each session using an online platform (Github)
 


## Notes:
1. Each session will be uploaded in a private playlist on youtube for ease of access after the session.
2. Students with a github account have privilege during the selection process. 
3. Required projects after each session could be adjusted.
4. Lack of commitment could lead to exclusion. 
5. Students with basics of any programming language are preferable. 
6. Additional sessions may be set to fulfill the content.
7. Student may need to bring his/her personal laptops.
